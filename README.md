Hello! Here are some projects I have worked on.
1) For my Inheritance Program, parts 1 through 3 are classes and the fourth part is the client program.
2) The Java Application calculates costs from items in two choice boxes (drop-down menus).
3) The Python Stock Tracker pulls data from the web and allows the user to write their purchase info to a file.
